SQL analysis of employee database

A sampling of SQL queries and joins.

Note that two options for table schema are included: id_Table_Schema.sql and
Table_Schema.sql. The first was the schema for creating serial integers as primary keys for
tables that have no unique identifier. The second was the schema I used for the project. Importing the data
into tables created with the id_Table_Schema caused errors. I was able to add serial columns
for primary keys after pulling data in, however.
